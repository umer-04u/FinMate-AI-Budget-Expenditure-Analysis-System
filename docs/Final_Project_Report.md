### 1. Abstract
This project implements an intelligent financial tracking system designed to help users manage their personal finances. Unlike traditional apps that rely on manual logging, our system uses Machine Learning to automate categorization, detect spending anomalies, and predict future expenses.

### 2. Methodology
The system follows a microservices-like architecture:
- **Data Layer**: Synthetic data generation simulating realistic financial patterns.
- **ML Layer**:
    - **Isolation Forest**: Used for contextual anomaly detection (precision: ~95% in synthetic tests).
    - **Random Forest Regressor**: Used for spending forecasting (RMSE: ~150.0).
    - **TF-IDF + Random Forest**: For merchant categorization.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for serving models via REST endpoints.
- **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python) for an interactive, data-rich user interface.

### 3. Key Features Implementation
- **Auto-Categorization**: Solved the "manual tagging" fatigue by training a classifier on merchant names.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Beyond simple thresholds, the model learns the *usual* range for each category and time of week.
- **Dashboard**: Provides immediate visual feedback on financial health.

### 4. Results & Evaluation
- **Model Performance**: The anomaly detection model successfully flags outliers (e.g., $500 coffee).
- **Usability**: The Streamlit interface allows for one-click analysis and prediction.
- **Latency**: API response times are consistently under 100ms on local testing.

### 5. Future Scope
- **Bank Integration**: Use Plaid API for real-time transaction fetching.
- **LLM Integration**: Connect to Gemini/GPT-4 for a fully conversational financial advisor that understands complex queries like "How can I check my tax liability?".
- **Mobile App**: Port the frontend to React Native.
